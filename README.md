## Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

Aviator is an easy-to-play crash game that has attracted players due to
its simple mechanics and thrilling gameplay. Here's a quick guide to
playing Aviator:

### How the Game Works

-   **Objective**: The goal is to bet on how high a plane will fly
    before it crashes. The earlier you cash out, the safer your bet. If
    you wait too long, the plane may crash, and you'll lose your wager.
-   **Multiplier**: The longer the plane flies, the higher the
    multiplier. The key is to cash out at the right time to maximize
    your winnings.

### Betting and Cashing Out

-   **Bet Amount**: Set your bet amount before each round starts.
-   **Cashing Out**: Once the round begins, watch the plane fly. You can
    cash out at any time before the crash, which will multiply your bet
    by the current multiplier.
-   **Auto Cash Out**: Some apps allow you to set an automatic cash-out
    at a certain multiplier, which can help reduce the risk.
